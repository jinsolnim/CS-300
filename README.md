## ðŸ“Œ Reflection

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**  
In these projects, I solved the challenge of managing course data efficiently. Project One focused on analyzing how vectors, hash tables, and balanced binary search trees perform for storing, searching, and sorting course information. Project Two built on that by implementing a working C++ program that loads course data, stores it in a binary search tree, and prints an alphanumeric list of courses.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**  
I approached the problem by matching each requirement to the data structure that best balances speed, memory, and ease of use. Understanding data structures is essential because the right choice dramatically affects performance and efficiency, especially for larger data sets.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**  
I ran into challenges with C++ syntax, pointer logic, and tree traversal. I overcame these by testing code step by step, reviewing course examples, and debugging thoroughly to ensure my implementation worked as expected.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**  
Working through these projects has improved my ability to evaluate trade-offs between different structures and choose the right one for each problem. I also think more critically about run-time complexity and how it affects usability.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**  
I now write clearer code with better structure, comments, and naming conventions, making it easier to maintain and expand. Iâ€™m more comfortable breaking larger tasks into smaller functions and using classes to organize logic cleanly.
