## ðŸ“Œ Reflection

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**  
In these projects, I solved the problem of storing, organizing, and retrieving course information using appropriate data structures and algorithms. For Project One, I compared how different data structures (vector, hash table, and binary search tree) perform in terms of run-time and memory efficiency. For Project Two, I implemented a C++ program that loads course data, stores it, sorts it, and prints it in alphanumeric order.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**  
I approached the problem by first analyzing the requirements and then selecting the most efficient data structures for the tasks. Understanding data structures is important because the right structure can make a huge difference in how fast and efficient a program runs, especially as data size grows.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**  
One challenge I faced was handling pointers and memory management in C++. To overcome this, I broke the code into smaller parts, tested them step by step, and used debugging tools to find errors. I also reviewed lecture material and referenced documentation when needed.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**  
Working on these projects has strengthened my ability to choose the right data structures for the problem at hand. I now think more carefully about how each decision impacts run-time performance and memory use when designing software.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**  
Through these projects, I have improved my coding style by writing clearer comments, using descriptive names, and organizing my code into logical, reusable functions. This makes my programs easier to understand, maintain, and expand in the future.
